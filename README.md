# Enriched PointNet++ and RandLA-NET Point-Cloud-Semantic-Segmentation
This GitHub repository has been created for the research project titled "Improving Aerial Targeting Precision: A Study on Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation with Advanced Deep Learning Algorithms."

This repository contains the code for the Color-Enhanced PointNet++ and RandLA-NET algorithms. 
Additionally, the dataset produced within the scope of the study is also provided in this repository.

Access to the photogrammetrically produced 3D Point Cloud dataset can be obtained from the DATA folder within the repository. The DublinCity dataset can be accessed from the following address: https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/dublincity/
